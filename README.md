# **An Arduino based Lithium Battery Tester...**
### or ALBT for short :)

This is a full-stack application made with React.JS, Node.JS and PostgreSQL to generate and save lithium-ion battery performance reports.
The application gets the data directly from the RS232 port of an Arduino programmed to perform the tests automatically.

It's a tool I use at work (or used to use depending on how far in the future you are reading this).
