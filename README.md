# **An Arduino based Lithium Battery Tester...**
### or ALBT for short :)

This is just a small project for my current job.
It is about using an Arduino to automate the test of lithium ion batteries.

The idea is that the Arduino tests them and a Node.js server takes the data through the serial port to make the reports.
